    "## Introduction\n",
    "The purpose of this data science project is to analyze and predict player behaviours on a Minecraft server based on data collected by a UBC Computer Science research group. This data consisted of two primary files: players.csv and sessions.csv. The players.csv file included detailed information about each player, such as their age, experience level, email, and other personal traits. The sessions.csv file tracked individual play sessions for each player based on their email, including data on session times. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Research Question\n",
    "\n",
    "**What player characteristics and behaviors are most predictive of subscribing to a game-related newsletter, and how do these features differ between various player types?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The specific question we addressed in this project is: \"Can experience level, age, and total hours played predict newsletter subscription?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "By analyzing the age, total hours played, and experience level of a player, we will build a predictive model (K-NN Classification) to assess the likelihood of a player subscribing to the newsletter based on such characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To answer this question, we focus solely on using the players.csv dataset file, as it includes the relevant characteristics we will be using to hypothesize a player's subscription behaviour. This will involve exploring the dataset to understand the relationships between these variables and subscription status, followed by the development and assessment of the accuracy of our model to form predictions. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dataset Description\n",
    "\n",
    "The `players` dataset contains 196 observations with the following variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `experience` (chr): Player experience level (Pro, Veteran, Regular, Amateur)\n",
    "- `subscribe` (lgl): Whether the player subscribed to the newsletter\n",
    "- `played_hours` (dbl): Total hours played\n",
    "- `Age` (dbl): Player's age\n",
    "- `gender` (chr): Player's gender (not used in this analysis)\n",
    "- `hashedEmail` (chr): Player's email (not used in this analysis)\n",
    "- `name` (chr): Player's name (not used in this analysis)\n",
    "\n",
    "This analysis uses techniques covered in the DSCI 100 course, including data wrangling, visualization, and K-Nearest Neighbors classification.\n"

    "K-NN classifies new observations by comparing them to similar, labeled examples in the training set. This is effective when we want to base predictions not on assumptions about the data but on how similar a new observation is to other known observations. Since we are working with a binary classification (TRUE/FALSE) and want to leverage patterns found in past player behavior, K-NN is a suitable choice for building our predictive model.\n",
    "\n",

    "**We selected the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm because it is non-parametric, easy to understand, and directly influenced by the similarity between features. This cooperates well with our small dataset and helps build an easy understanding of how different features impact prediction outcomes.**\n",

    "The plot indicates that subscribed players tend to have higher median and maximum playtime. This seems intuitive and matches what we expected—more invested players may want to stay updated. However, it’s also possible that subscription leads to more engagement over time (reverse causality).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Figure 3: Age Distribution by Subscription**  \n",
    "Younger players appear more likely to subscribe. This may reflect digital habits: Younger users tend to be more open to email subscriptions and more accustomed to in-game notifications and marketing. Oppositely, it may be that older users are less willing to accept.                                                              \n",

    "**Predictive Model**  \n",
    "With all things considered, the model is most likely to predict that a young player with a high experience level and a high playtime will be someone who will be subscribed to the newsletter, whereas it will predict an older player with a low experience level and a low playtime as someone who wouldn't subscribe. Overall, the model can predict a player's subscription given their age, experience level, and hours played with about 71% accuracy."

    "### **Impact**  \n",
    "These findings can help game developers better understand user behavior. For example, promotional efforts could be tailored to high-playtime players to increase conversions. Knowing that experience and age influence subscription likelihood, marketing emails could highlight tips, achievements, or community events to attract younger or more engaged players. Furthermore, the game team could also consider promoting newsletter subscriptions through platforms like Instagram and TikTok, which are more popular among younger audiences.  \n",
    "\\\n",
    "What’s more, building a model can help us make predictions because, in reality, users do not only subscribe based on their own preferences but also act in response to the expectations of others. As a result, the final outcome may lead to situations where users with the financial ability to subscribe do not do so (David et al., 2008).  \n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, the model can be used to further engage with players that the model predicted to be potential subscribers. In other words, for players that the model predicts to be subscribers, further efforts can be made to convince them to subscribe to the newsletter."

    "### **Limitations of the Model**\n",
    "After evaluating the KNN classification results (accuracy: 0.7119, precision: 0.4545, recall: 0.3125), we identified several reasons that likely affected the model’s performance. These issues can be grouped into five main parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Data quality and consistency issues.**  \n",
    "The dataset seems self-reported by players, thus, there are some inconsistencies. For example, some players are labeled as ”Veteran”, but their play hours is 0. Such contradictions indicate data entry errors. A possible solution is to set data filtering rules: ”Veteran” players must have at least 100 hours of game time.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. The model is sensitive to outliers.**  \n",
    "Extreme values in variables such as played hours or age can interfere with KNN algorithms, which affect classification results.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. The sample size was insufficient.**  \n",
    "With only 196 players in the dataset, the sample may not be sufficiently representative of the overall player population. In particular, certain groups of people (e.g., older players, non-male genders, or very casual users) may be underrepresented, potentially biasing the model’s conclusions. Expanding the dataset with more diverse and balanced samples would improve the generalizability of the findings.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. The current prediction ability is relatively weak.**  \n",
    "Variables such as age, played hours, and experience level are not good predictors. These variables may have some correlation with subscription status, but there is no strong relationship. For instance, older players may be more likely to subscribe, but this does not mean that age directly causes subscription behavior (reverse causality). Therefore, these variables may introduce noise in the model’s performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. One of  the more predictive alternative features.**  \n",
    "Platform Bias: The dataset does not capture which channels players encountered or accessed the subscription option. Players who engage primarily via mobile or social platforms might behave differently. Future data collection could include interaction channels to analyze cross-platform behavior differences.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the Ampere analysis’s data from Q3 of 2023, the content update strategies of various platforms vary: Netflix (mobile), Xbox, and PC have added a large number of games, while some console-based service platforms play a trend of decreasing players. This suggests that players on mobile platforms may be experiencing more dynamic content news (Ampere Analysis et al., 2023).\n"

    "### **Future Questions**\n",
    "In this analysis, we only analyze how a player's age, experience level, and played hours can determine their subscription. Thus, for future analysis, we can look into how other player features may impact the likelihood that a player will subscribe to the newsletter or not. For example, we can collect data on whether the player prefers group or solo play, which country they are located in, whether they prefer to play competitively or recreationally, and much more. \n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, we only used the players' dataset in our analysis. In the future, we could incorporate the time of day the player tends to prefer to game and the frequency of their playing sessions and build a model incorporating these player characteristics."
